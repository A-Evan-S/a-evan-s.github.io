<h2 id="why">Why</h2>
<p>I'm a big fan of being mediocre at things. So many interesting hobbies and activities are ruined by being good enough to worry if you're good enough. I strive to know just enough to make little projects, but not enough to ever be confused for someone who knows what they're doing. It is an absolutely wonderful resting spot on the learning curve.</p>
<p>In creating this website, I started to pay more attention to how other websites are designed, and one aspect I could not wrap my brain around was fonts. Thousands of fonts to choose from, each with vocal proponents and detractors. I've also recently seen the creation of "variable fonts", with the ability to manually adjust all manner of different dimensions. I can vaguely tell when I dislike a font, in the sense that it can be distracting from the content, but feel totally unable to connect the minor details to the overall look.</p>
<p>So, I decided to make my own font.</p>
<p>To be clear, I went in with no ambitions to make a font good enough for use on this website or elsewhere. I'm not <em>that</em> naive. My goal instead was to go from "zero" to "bad" at font design, and in the process hopefully understand enough to have some opinions on fonts going forward.</p>
<p>I googled "font design software" and found <a href="https://FontForge.org/">FontForge</a>, which was free, open source, and had a tutorial<sup id="fnref:tutorial"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:tutorial" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Perfect.</p>
<h2 id="design-goals">Design Goals</h2>
<p>Despite my real intention just being to learn along the way, I did want to set out goals for my font and came up with the following list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to read: pretty low bar to pass, but if you can't read the font I don't really know what we're doing here</li>
<li>Easy to make: I don't know what I'm doing, so this was kind of a necessity</li>
<li>Offends some people: if I'm not annoying anyone with my decisions, we're not being bold enough</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking back, the one thing I wish I had spent more time on early on would be deciding on a specific use-case for this font. Again, not that I planned to actually use it, but instead because I would later learn that making a "general use-case" font turns out to be a far too lofty goal than picking a more singular application.</p>
<p>I did eventually start isolating some inspiration for the design: I like hiking, so my main thought for what I'd like to create was "would this look good on a trailhead or park sign". This mostly just means it should look good at a large size, be simple with minimal flourishes, and have a mix of professional and natural themes. In my mind's eye, I was envisioning something that could be easily carved into or painted onto wood.</p>
<p>As for the name, taking after outdoor recreation where I live, I decided to name the font after the beaches of the bay area: <strong>San's Sands Sans</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>Right off the bat we're presented with a bunch of choices, none of which I know anything about. I'm to enter values for "Ascent" and "Descent". No idea what those meant, but this image helped clear things up:</p>
<figure style="margin: 40px auto">

<p>This shows the handful of vertical metrics most useful for keeping characters consistent. FontForge has a tool to add and name guides to the glyph editor so you can see these heights while working. Here's an example of what my view looked like later in the project.</p>
<p><a href="font_5.png"><img alt="Example of FontForge's named guide tools" src="font_5-400w.webp" srcset="font_5-400w.webp 400w, font_5-800w.webp 800w, font_5-600w.webp 600w" style="max-width: 400px" / sizes="(width <= 400px) 100vw, 400px"></a></p>
<p>The ascent and descent had default values of 800 and 200, which I didn't question. I did end up changing these later, but what I actually should have been noticing is how the example word "Sphinx" omits any characters with features in the middle of the glyph like the bar in 'A' or cross in 't'. Not planning for these caused some frustrating edits later on.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, we're left with a blank slate of different glyphs. Specifically, the <code>ISO 8859-1</code> characters. This seemed like a reasonable enough set to start with, though at this point I figured I might bail on some of the special characters.</p>
<p><a href="font_1.png"><img alt="FontForge's default view of all the characters in the encoding" src="font_1-800w.webp" srcset="font_1-800w.webp 800w, font_1-600w.webp 600w, font_1-400w.webp 400w" style="max-width: 500px" / sizes="(width <= 500px) 100vw, 500px"></a></p>
<p>On to making characters! I thought I had a rough Idea of what I wanted for a capital 'A': 3 straight lines drawn with a circular tip to create rounded ends but sharp intersections. I figured characters couldn't get much easier than this, so it would be a good easy one to use to figure things out.</p>
<p><a href="font_2.png"><img alt="A very poor attempt to freehand draw the letter 'A'" src="font_2-400w.webp" srcset="font_2-400w.webp 400w, font_2-600w.webp 600w, font_2-800w.webp 800w" style="max-width: 400px" / sizes="(width <= 400px) 100vw, 400px"></a></p>
<p>Nailed it.</p>
<p>While I have done some basic vector drawing with bezier curves before, I had no idea how to use these tools to make consistent widths or angles.</p>
<p>After probably an hour of playing around with the tools, I got a reasonable-ish 'A':</p>
<p><a href="font_3.png"><img alt="A corrected version of the letter 'A'" src="font_3-600w.webp" srcset="font_3-600w.webp 600w, font_3-400w.webp 400w" style="max-width: 400px" / sizes="(width <= 400px) 100vw, 400px"></a></p>
<p>Shortly after this I found the "Expand" tool to do what I had wanted without having to manually measure each width myself. I decided from here to do a test run making an incredibly rough draft of all the lowercase letters, mostly so that I would be able to see future drafts of each in at least some context while I worked. To do this, I just used the hand-draw tool to sketch some lines and expand the stroke to a uniform width.</p>
<p>Here's a sample of what that first version looked like:</p>
<div style='text-align: center'>
  <p style='font-family: "sans_sands_sans_01"; font-size:1.5em'>
      the quick red fox jumps over the lazy brown dog
  </p>
</div>

<h2 id="uniformity">Uniformity</h2>
<p>While there are lots of things wrong with this first pass, I was actually pleasantly surprised. That is legible text that wouldn't immediately make me think anything was broken or wrong. It might make me question any person who would choose to use it, but in an "oh, you're pretty quirky, huh?" way, not in an "I question your sanity" way.</p>
<p>Immediately, two things stood out to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>the size of characters jumps around wildly</li>
<li>straight lines are not straight</li>
</ul>
<p>These are both true of my handwriting as well, so maybe that's why I wasn't too bothered while working on it.</p>
<p>Using the guidelines tool mentioned above, I was able to get at least the vertical sizing a bit more consistent. Straight lines also weren't too difficult of a challenge, but did require me to start manipulating points directly and figure out what each tool did. I also started looking for shortcuts to reuse pieces of each letter, both for uniformity and convenience.</p>
<p>After a few hours of tweaking sizes and lines, I got to draft #2 (still only lowercase letters):</p>
<div style='text-align: center'>
  <p style='font-family: "sans_sands_sans_02"; font-size:1.5em'>
      the quick red fox jumps over the lazy brown dog
  </p>
</div>

<h2 id="wait-its-bad">Wait, it's bad?</h2>
<p>I stumbled upon something maybe obvious to people who know what they're doing, but in trying to aim for uniformity it made lots of oddities stand out <strong>more</strong> to me. My first version, though deeply flawed, looked like familiar enough to my handwriting that no one character looked "wrong". This new version, with all its matching pieces, seems to make the awkward pieces stand out.</p>
<p>Relatedly, I found lots of things that my brain tell me should look natural and even look terrible in practice. For example, using a circle to create a lowercase 'e' ends up looking like it has a massive overbite:</p>
<p><a href="font_4.png"><img alt="The letter 'e' made from a circle (it looks bad)" src="font_4-600w.webp" srcset="font_4-600w.webp 600w, font_4-400w.webp 400w" style="max-width: 400px" / sizes="(width <= 400px) 100vw, 400px"></a></p>
<p>As for what I wanted to change from here, a few things stood out while working:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spacing -- I had just been using the "Auto Width" tool to get the spacing close enough to accurate for testing, but some places the spacing looks very obviously weird</li>
<li>Tails -- I don't know the real term, but in standardizing things I removed the tails from the 't', 'l', and 'u' characters. I'm not sure about the 'u', but for the others I think it looks a little more natural with them included.</li>
<li>Widths -- I didn't use any guide for the widths, but most turned out okay. However, a think a few are too narrow/wide.</li>
<li>'q' and 'g' shape -- I copied the 'a' character for both the 'q' and 'g', and I'm rethinking that decision. It's not bad, but I wanted to see what they would look like with different shapes.</li>
<li>Descenders -- These were way trickier than I imagined. Making them uniform looked terrible, but doing them each independently had mixed results. I also think I might want to adjust the ratios of the various pieces.</li>
</ul>
<p>A couple more hours tweaking and we get the following:</p>
<div style='text-align: center'>
  <p style='font-family: "sans_sands_sans_03"; font-size:1.5em'>
      the quick red fox jumps over the lazy brown dog
  </p>
</div>

<h2 id="more-characters">More Characters</h2>
<p>It looks like a font! There are still a few changes from this point that I'd make to the lowercase letters (I liked the change to 'g' and decided to make similar changes to the 'q' and 'a') and the spacing could use a bit more fine tuning, but we're a lot closer than before.</p>
<p>There's still a massive challenge though, as, while I didn't set my sights <em>too</em> high to call this completed, I did feel the need to implement all the uppercase letters and digits, as well as common punctuation. Similar to how I approached the lowercase letters, I thought I'd start with just a super fast pass through the uppercase letters to get a feel for things. I ended up with this:</p>
<div style='text-align: center'>
  <p style='font-family: "sans_sands_sans_04"; font-size:1.5em'>
      THE QUICK RED FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY BROWN DOG
  </p>
</div>

<p>Similar to my first pass at the lowercase letters, spacing and width need some work, and I wasn't happy with most of the curved letters. I was, however, happy to have a draft done so that I can look at everything together. I was on a roll, so I figured I'd finish off first drafts for the digits, punctuation, and symbols as well.</p>
<div style='text-align: center'>
  <p style='font-family: "sans_sands_sans_04"; font-size:1.5em'>
      0123456789<br>
      !"#$%&'()*+,-./<br>
      :;<=>?@[]\^`{}|~<br>
  </p>
</div>

<p>I put some time into the symbols and punctuation, so I was mostly happy there, but the numbers needed a lot of work.</p>
<h2 id="resizing">Resizing</h2>
<p>At this point, with a rough set of uppercase letters, numerals, and symbols I realized that I fucked up pretty hard at the outset. Using the default values for ascent and descent were fine (though I did end up increasing the descent size), but I had chosen an xHeight way too low. With an ascent of 800 (capHeight of 750) I had chosen a xHeight of 470. This was somewhat apparent when comparing the height of uppercase letters and lowercase ones, but was really apparent as I tried to make some of the symbols balanced:</p>
<div style='text-align: center'>
  <p style='font-family: "sans_sands_sans_04"; font-size:1.5em'>
      &lt;Not too bad&gt; <br> &lt;oops&gt;
  </p>
</div>

<p>I wasn't totally oblivious to this earlier, but hadn't realized that in many fonts uppercase letters with middle features (e.g. the bar across the 'A' or the split between the two sections of the 'B') don't match the xHeight. I also took this opportunity to swap to an em-size of 1024 to match the ttf format.</p>

<h2 id="final-touches-testing">Final Touches &amp; Testing</h2>
<p>While the remaining edits accounted for only small changes, they took lots of trial and error and more time than you would think. Most of that is likely due to my inefficiencies in working with FontForge, but I'd like to think some was from honing a sharper eye to details I would have previously overlooked.</p>
<div style='text-align: center'>
  <p style='font-family: "sans_sands_sans"; font-size:1.5em'>
      ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ<br>
      abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz<br>
      0123456789<br>
  </p>
</div>

<p>A lot of the last changes were actually breaking the standardization I'd held to up to this point. I tried to reuse pieces of letters as much as possible, but some things looked better slightly off, like the curved top of the 'P' and 'R' being different, or the period being a bit larger than the comma.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, while I'll likely never have a use for the end result, I think I accomplished my goals.

<h2 id="reflections">Reflections</h2>
<p>I had heard previously about how much work making a font is, but I don't think I really knew what that meant. I suppose in part it's that it takes a lot of time. That seems true enough; this simplest of simple attempts probably took ~15 hours, so I can imagine for the kind of work a professional would do the sheer time investment could balloon.</p>
<p>However, that's not really the take-away I came out with. What really struck me as a unique challenge was trying to balance so many details while maintaining uniformity throughout. Even just the standard uppercase and lowercase letters are <em>just</em> numerous enough to make it impossible to keep everything in your head at one time. I imagine that's one of the skills that would be necessary for success when designing fonts: on hour 143, when you're tweaking the same glyph for the umpteenth time, you still need to maintain a singular vision for the work as a whole.</p>
